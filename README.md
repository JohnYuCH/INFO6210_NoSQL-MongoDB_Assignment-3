# INFO6210_NoSQL-MongoDB_Assignment-3
For this project, I first transfered the Sneaker mysql database to nosql database, then I added two main collections of twitter user collection. One is based on their tags of different brand sneakers. The other one is a general sneaker information collection. The user information are from twitter api. After I built the mongodb database. I implemented bunches of different queries on the database, including finding all the documents of each database, finding documents with certain values in a collection, etc. When answering the last question of 'What people, places or things are trending in your domain? (A trend is popularity over time.) ', I added three more collections, each of which is a sub collection of the General user collection. The purpose of these three collections are counting the certain field of the user and show their trends. Finally, I answered the questions. 

The mongodb database contains 10 collections, 5 original converted sneaker information collections, two collections of user information scraped from twitter api. Three additional collections for the purpose of data analysis.
